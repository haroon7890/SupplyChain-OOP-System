**Language:** C++  
**Semester:** 2nd Semester  
**Concepts Used:** Object-Oriented Programming, Inheritance, Polymorphism, File Handling, Pointers

## Overview

This is a **console-based supply chain management system** developed in C++.  
It allows you to manage products and orders efficiently, including normal and perishable products.  

Key functionalities:  
- Add, edit, and remove products  
- Restock products  
- Place and fulfill orders  
- File-based persistent storage for inventory and orders  

This project was developed as part of my **OOP course** to demonstrate practical understanding of object-oriented design and real-world problem solving.
